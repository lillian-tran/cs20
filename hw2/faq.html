            <h3>How old do I have to be?</h3>
            <p>Rise Young serves young people from ages 5-19. Many of our participants join us as soon as possible after their 5th birthday and choose to stay all the way into young adulthood, but you can join at any age within that range. We work closely with parents if the individual is still a minor.</p>
            <h3>How can I apply?</h3>
            <p>Our applications for the next year have already closed, but they typically open in August every year.</p>
            <h3>What's the application process like?</h3>
            <p>The application requires two reference letters, a short essay, and some biographical information. There are also two rounds of interviews.</p>
            <h3>What are the perks of being a Rise Young participant?</h3>
            <p>Rise Young allows you to access whatever resources you need to be successful, thanks to the generosity of our donors. There are also a tremendous number of unique opportunities, available to participants of all ages. Finally, we have a dynamic network of alumni across all fields and professions always willing to help. </p>
